 New platforms emerges, offering rewards simply for completing surveys. But beware, for amidst this opportunity lies the risk of scams. Companies seeking accurate data must contend with the vulnerability of current systems to manipulation by survey distributors.  Enter blockchain, It allows companies to create surveys directly, with unchangeable data stored securely. Yet, existing blockchain solutions suffer from a flaw: public visibility and tracking of data.  Survearn is a cutting-edge survey platform that rewards users with Matic tokens for completing surveys. Upon completion, users receive Matic tokens directly into their accounts. One key feature is the use of the Secret Network to encrypt survey data, ensuring only survey creators can access user responses. This guarantees privacy and security. By leveraging blockchain for data storage and encryption, we provide a transparent and incentivized system for users and creators alike.
