About code : this is modified smart contract from secret official repository, modified smart contract included for :

Survearn is a cutting-edge survey platform that rewards users with Matic tokens for completing surveys. Upon completion, users receive Matic tokens directly into their accounts. One key feature is the use of the Secret Network to encrypt survey data, ensuring only survey creators can access user responses. This guarantees privacy and security. By leveraging blockchain for data storage and encryption, we provide a transparent and incentivized system for users and creators alike.
